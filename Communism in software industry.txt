The software ecosystem supporting deep learning research has been 
evolving quickly, and has now reached a healthy state: open-source 
software is the norm; a variety of frameworks are available, satisfying 
needs spanning from exploring novel ideas to deploying them into 
production; and strong industrial players are backing different software 
stacks in a stimulating competition. 
I cannot thank you enough for all your hard work. IMO, Theano is the single best thing that has happened to the field machine learning in the last decade.
Also, good call stopping now.
I started my journey of deep learning with Theano. Thanks a lot for all the contribution!!!!
